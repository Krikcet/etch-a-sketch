The project has been styled to resemble the etch-a-sketch toys;

By clicking the 'Start Fresh' button, the user will be prompted to enter a number that is effectively the square root of the amount of squares that will be created in the screen. The higher the number, the smaller the squares will be. 80 is the highest input allowed.

The user can then use their mouse as a stylus to draw multicolored lines. 
Each square will change to a random color on mouseover. 
The color gets darker with each pass, and will turn black after ten passes.
My github is also linked on the bottom-right button.
